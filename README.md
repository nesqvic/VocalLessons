# Mama said - Metallica

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when as young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what I heard her say
Son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still

"Rebel" my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron string's around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
What never I gave
But she gave me her emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
What never I gave
But she gave me her emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I needed your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
What never I gave
But she gave me her emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
