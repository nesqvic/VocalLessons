# Zombie - Bad Wolves

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence causes silence
Who are we mistaken?
 
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their guns, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
 
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
 
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
 
It's the same old theme
Since nineteen sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their guns, and their drones
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
 
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
 
It's the same old theme
In two thousand twenties
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
 
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
